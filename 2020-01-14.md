# Performance testing frameworks for Python

While looking for performance/load testing frameworks for Python,
I came across [`locust`](https://locust.io/) and
[`pytest-benchmark`](https://github.com/ionelmc/pytest-benchmark/):

- I've used `locust` once before, it has a nice UI to monitor
  your tests. If you want to test your APIs from a client's
  perspective end-to-end, `locust` is the right tool to use.
  It also supports running your load tests distributed across
  different machines.

- `pytest-benchmark` integrates seamlessly with `pytest` if you're
  already using it. It's really simple to configure and use it as
  a global fixture:

  ```python
  def function_a(arg1, arg2, **args):
    """The function we need to benchmark"""
    pass

  def test_performance_of_function_a(benchmark):
    result = benchmark(function_a, arg1, arg2, ...)
  ```

  However it poses a problem if the function to benchmark is not idempotent
  i.e. invoking it continuously produces different results - for intsance,
  the function involves deleting entries from the database. If this is the
  case then `pytest-benchmark` is not the right choice.
