# All about backup in Postgres

## Backup certain tables only

```sh
pg_dump --column-inserts -a -t table_1 -t "table_2*" -f db_dump
```

## Backup without owners and ACLs

Make your life easier, especially for local development, by not having any access
control getting into the way.

```sh
pg_dump --no-owner --no-acl
```

## Optimize Postgres backup and restore

If speed is the key factor and you can afford extra disk space, disable built-in
compression or you can always compress the dump afterwards if needed. Using the
postgres's custom format speeds up the process.

```sh
pg_dump -Fc -Z0 -f db_dump
```

To restore:

```sh
pg_restore -Fc -C db_dump
```

You can also use `-j` option to run multiple jobs for the process.

If your dump has data that has triggers such as foreign constraints, you can disable
triggers during the restore. You also need to run the restore sequentially
without `-j` option.


```sh
pg_restore -Fc --disable-triggers -C db_dump
```

It would be easier if your dump is plain old SQL. Just need to add the following
statement to the top of your SQL file:

```sql
-- at the beginning
SET session_replication_role = replica;

...

-- at the end
SET session_replication_role = DEFAULT;
```
