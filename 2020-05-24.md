# My first learning experience with AWS ECS backed by EC2

Two months ago, I was tasked with upgrading one of our service, and as part
of it containerizing the application and deploying it to AWS ECS.

The reason we chose ECS with EC2 launch type instead of Fargate is because we
need persistent data storage, which isn't supported by Fargate at the time of
this writing. EKS is out of picture because we just want to run a simple
single container setup and hence don't need the complexity that Kubernetes
brings with it.

If you ask me what type of product ECS is, I think the best answer is it's a
container orchestration service. Sounds familiar? Yes, like Kubernetes.

My impression of ECS before I actually use it is that you give it the images
and it will run them in an managed manner for you. I was so wrong.

In order to use ECS, you need to have a bunch of services around it ready to
support ECS:

- You have to manage the EC2 fleet where your containers run on - either by
  provisioning them manually or using Auto Scaling (which I use)
- You need to have a load balancer ready to forward network traffic to your
  containers
- Most likely you'd have a VPC with public and private subnets, and appropriate
  security groups already to allocate your resources with them. If not, setting
  them up is not hard but requires some work.
- IAM policies, getting it right is a lot of trial-and-error effort, I had to
  dig through AWS documentation jungle and plenty of StackOverflow questions to
  get it right.

Once you get the supporting infrastructure ready, it's time to configure your
ECS cluster:

- You need to understand the concepts used by ECS. These are the building blocks:
  - **container instance** - the ECS instance which acts as the host for your
    containers
  - **cluster** - a collection of EC2 container instances that ECS use to deploy
    your Docker containers on. A cluster is a logical group of ECS services.
  - **service** - the one that manages, deploys and orchestrates a task or a group
    of tasks
  - **task** - a task is essentially a single instance of Docker container or a
    group of them, which is defined by the task definition. Tasks are often
    executed and managed by ECS service, however they can be run manually for
    ad-hoc need.
  - **task definition** - defines the blueprint of how to start the Docker
    containers, the resources allocated to each of them and other settings.
    The easiest way to relate to a task definition is thinking of it like a
    `docker-compose.yml` file.
- But that's not the end:
  - **ECS container agent** - the agent process that runs on each EC2 instance.
    It's the one that registers the EC2 instance with your cluster, handles
    communication between the EC2 instance and the scheduler, and the one that
    actually starts the Docker containers.
  - **ECS-optimized AMI** - these are AMIs that are specialized to launch the
    container instances. They include the container agent and have Docker already
    installed. You may select the specific AMI for your particular region.

It's easier to visualize the all of them as a whole, the architected presented by
AWS itself is here https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/images/overview-standard.png.
Though I find the pictures below is easier to understand. Here is a cluster that has
a single service managing 4 tasks (of a same task definition).
