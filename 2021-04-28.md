# How to properly derive state from props with React hooks

```js
function MyComponent(props) {
  const [name, setName] = useState(props.nickname);

  // ...
  // continue to use `name` and `setName` afterwards
}
```

With the above code, `name` won't be updated when `MyComponent` re-renders or
`nickname` props change. I found the best way to explain it is consider doing
this as setting state from props in a constructor of class-based components.
Doing so causes the state to be not updated when the corresponding prop changes
because the constructor is only called once on instantiation. Essentially,
`useState` should be used to _only_ set the **initial state**.

The proper way to derive state from props is:

```js
function MyComponent(props) {
  const [name, setName] = useState(props.nickname);

  useEffect(() => {
    setName(props.nickname);
  }, [props.nickname]);

  // ...
}
```
