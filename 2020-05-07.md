# `fetch` API gotcha with `multipart/form-data`

Today I stumbled upon a strange error when trying to upload files
using `multipart/form-data` with `fetch`. I could see the request
data seems to be correct i.e. there are multiple parts and they aren't
empty. It turns out that we're not supposed to set the `Content-Type`
header when dealing with `multipart/form-data` requests.

From the [one of the comments](https://github.com/github/fetch/issues/505#issuecomment-293064470)
in the GitHub issue referenced below:

> Setting the `Content-Type` header manually means it's missing the
  boundary parameter. Remove that header and allow `fetch` to generate
  the full content type.
>
> Fetch knows which content type header to create based on the `FormData`
  object passed in as the request body content.
