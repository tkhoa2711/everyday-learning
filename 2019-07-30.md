# Web worker with JS modules
I was using `js-xlsx` library for parsing Excel spreadsheets in a Vue project.
I was keen to use Web Worker to perform the processing in a separate thread.
However the app wan't able to run as `webpack` unable to import the `xlsx`
module in the worker script file.

Some people suggests adding the module using `<script>` tag in the static `index.html`
but that also didn't work for me too.

Looking at some example by `xlsx`, they're using `importScripts` which I may try next.
