# Different types of worker in the browser (Worker API)
This article sums them up well https://bitsofco.de/web-workers-vs-service-workers-vs-worklets/

# Web worker with JS modules
I was using `js-xlsx` library for parsing Excel spreadsheets in a Vue project.
I was keen to use Web Worker to perform the processing in a separate thread.
However the app wan't able to run as `webpack` unable to import the `xlsx`
module in the worker script file.

Some people suggests adding the module using `<script>` tag in the static `index.html`
but that also didn't work for me too.

Looking at some example by `xlsx`, they're using `importScripts` which I may try next.

# Peer dependencies in JS project
In short, peer dependencies ensure that the dependencies listed in the current project
will be exactly the same used by the parent project in the dependency tree.
