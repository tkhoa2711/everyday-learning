# Update poetry lock file without upgrading dependencies

If you update the `pyproject.toml` by hand, you would need to update the
`poetry.lock` file. Seems straightforward, but not so with `poetry`.

Running `poetry update <dep>` will not only update that dependency but also the
others in the list - which is annoying. Unfortunately, `poetry lock` also does
the same.

There are some workarounds for this issue at the moment:

- update an already-up-to-date package, for e.g. `foo`. Running `poetry update foo`
  will leave foo at the current version and re-generate the lock file.

- add and remove a package that doesn't exist in the dependency tree (lock file)

  ```sh
  poetry add insecure-package && poetry remove insecure-package
  ```
