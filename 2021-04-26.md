# DynamoDB batch write operation

While this `batch_write_item` interface exists, it has many limitations that I
think are deal killers for a developer-friendly API:
- A maximum batch of 25 items
- You must implement retry of individual failed items in the batch operation

Luckily there is a better alternative `Table.batch_writer`. It can handle a
large amount of items:

```py
with table.batch_writer() as batch:
    batch.put_item(Item={...})
    batch.put_item(Item={...})
    batch.delete_item(Item={...})
```
