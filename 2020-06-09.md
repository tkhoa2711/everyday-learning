# Rename a stash in git

Git doesn't support renaming a stash natively. The only way is to pop a
stash out and add it in again with a name or message. It's easier to create
an alias so we don't have to execute multiple commands. Add a new alias by:

```sh
git config --global alias.stash-rename '!_() { rev=$(git rev-parse $1) && git stash drop $1 || exit 1 ; git stash store -m "$2" $rev; }; _'
```

After that, you can rename a given stash by:

```sh
git stash-rename stash@{0} "some more meaningful message"
```
