# The Terraform world

# Zero downtime update of resources

```tf
resource "example" "example" {
  # ...

  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
```

This meta-argument (that's how it's called) overrides the default behaviour
of a resource which can't be updated in-place: instead of destroying and
then recreating it, the new resource will be created first and then the old
one would be destroyed. This is often used to ensure zero-downtime deployment
for critical infrastructure components.
