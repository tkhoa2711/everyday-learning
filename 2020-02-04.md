# Edit git historical commit

Given the hash of the commit you want to modify

```sh
git rebase --interactive '<hash>^'
```

Please note the caret `^` at the end of the command,
because you need actually to rebase back to the commit
before the one you wish to modify.

Make modifications and stage your change. Then run:

```sh
git commit --amend
```

That's done. Now we just need to continue rebasing:

```sh
git rebase --continue
```
