# Edit git historical commit

Given the hash of the commit you want to modify

```sh
git rebase --interactive '<hash>^'
```

Please note the caret `^` at the end of the command,
because you need actually to rebase back to the commit
before the one you wish to modify.

Make modifications and stage your change. Then run:

```sh
git commit --amend
```

That's done. Now we just need to continue rebasing:

```sh
git rebase --continue
```

# Resolve conflict on a git branch (or learn how to embrace `reset` and `push --force`)

Imagine you're working on a new feature on the `feature` branch off `master`.
After a few days, you finish the changes and are ready to rebase it back to
`master`. This maybe what you do (and what I did):

- You rebase the current `master` to your local `feature` branch
  ```
  git checkout feature
  git rebase master
  ```
- There are some conflicts, but you resolved them all manually without
problems. However, now your local `feature` branch has diverged from the remote
branch on the server (assumming it's GitHub)
- If you're like me - trying to do another rebase from the remote feature
branch, you'll be able to push your local feature branch to GitHub
  ```sh
  git pull --rebase
  git push origin feature
  ```
- But you will end up with a bunch of changes from `master`, which are exact
duplicates of the thing you just rebased off `master`. This make the pull
request looks ugly with unwanted commits. Urghhh!

The 3rd step above should have been:

- force pushing the local `feature` branch to remote - essentially telling the
server that your local `feature` branch should be the golden copy.
  ```sh
  git push origin +feature
  ```

This is effectively rewriting the commit history of the `feature` branch. But
it's okay to do so because most likely other team members should not rely on
this branch for their work yet.

Anyway, the damage had been done. Luckily it's easy to fix at this stage. Let's
try to fix it:

- Reset the local `feature` to match the remote `feature` branch
  ```sh
  git reset --hard origin/feature
  ```
- Find the last good commit that you want to keep, the one before all the unwanted
commits rebased from master from the 2nd step above. Reset to that commit
  ```sh
  git reset <good-commit-hash>
  ```
- Redo the rebase from `master` again
  ```sh
  git rebase master
  ```
- After rebasing finishes, force-push the local `feature` branch
  ```sh
  git push origin +feature
  ```

You should now be able to create a nice PR out of the remote `feature` branch
on GitHub. Pheww!!!
