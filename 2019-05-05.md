# `git` commands
- add modified/deleted files to staged tree: `git add -u`
- view staged changes: `git diff --staged`

# Make a service waits for others in `docker-compose`
While `docker-compose` offers `depends_on` option, it's not particularly helpful in most cases.
For instance, MongoDB is quite slow in starting up and `docker-compose` doesn't actually wait.
Here comes the life saver [docker-compose-wait](https://github.com/ufoscout/docker-compose-wait).

Then it's simply adding the following lines to the `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
ADD https://github.com/ufoscout/docker-compose-wait/releases/download/2.5.0/wait /wait
RUN chmod +x /wait

# old: CMD npm run dev
# new:
CMD /wait && npm run dev 
```

`docker-compose.yml`:
```yml
version: "3"
services:
  my-app:
    image: "my-app:1.0"
    environment:
      - WAIT_HOSTS=mongodb:27017

  mongodb:
    image: mongo:4.0-xenial
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
```
