# Catch your email locally with `mailcatcher`
It's a simple SMTP server that... catches your emails and display it for preview
https://mailcatcher.me/.

## Installing locally
If you get this error while installing it on Mac OS (mine is 10.14.6) with `gem`:

```sh
mkmf.rb can't find header files for ruby at /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/2.0/usr/lib/ruby/include/ruby.h
```

Follow these instructions exactly to get it rolling again. I left out the
`sudo rm ...` part the first time and it didn't work.


```sh
sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
xcode-select --install
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
open /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg
```

## Use docker
I use the docker image from [schickling/mailcatcher](https://hub.docker.com/r/schickling/mailcatcher/)
because it's relatively small (~40MB). Otherwise you may use the office image
[sj26/mailcatcher](https://hub.docker.com/r/sj26/mailcatcher) (~261MB). This is it:

```sh
docker run -d -p 1080:1080 --name mailcatcher schickling/mailcatcher
```

Or with `docker-compose.yml`:

```yml
version: "3"
  mailcatcher:
    image: schickling/mailcatcher
    container_name: mailcatcher
    restart: on-failure:10
    ports:
      - "1080:1080"
      - "1025:1025"
```
