# Access docker host from a container

Use your internal IP address or connect to the special DNS name
`host.docker.internal`.

# Run `ngrok` using `docker`

The command below lets you run `ngrok` using docker:

```sh
docker run --rm -it -p 4040:4040 --expose 4040 -e NGROK_PORT=host.docker.internal:8000 --name ngrok wernight/ngrok
```

We need to run it in interactive mode in order to get the auto-generated
subdomain in the TTY, `ngrok` doesn't print that to `stdout`.

We need to expose port 4040 (in addition to mapping it) so that we can
access the inspector UI at [http://localhost:4040/](http://localhost:4040/).

## Or `docker-compose`

```yml
version: '3.7'
  ngrok:
    image: wernight/ngrok
    container_name: ngrok
    # we need both `stdin_open` and `tty` to keep STDIN and pseudo-terminal
    # open - so that we can `attach` to the container to retrieve the
    # random-generated domain (given that we're using the free version)
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
    restart: always
    volumes:
      # this is to authorise your ngrok credentials (if you already have an account)
      - ~/.ngrok2/:/home/ngrok/.ngrok2/
    ports:
      - "4040:4040"
    expose:
      - 4040 # expose this port so we can access the inspector UI of ngrok
    environment:
      # assuming you're running a non-dockerized server or process
      # that needs to be forwarded with ngrok to be publicly available;
      # if not, remove the below hostname `host.docker.internal`
      NGROK_PORT: host.docker.internal:8000
```

After the service starts, you can check the generated domain name with
`docker attach ngrok`. If you already have an account with `ngrok` -
even a free one, the domain should be available at least for several days
(which is pretty decent). The `volumes` configuration above assumes the
`ngrok` credentials are already stored in the given directory. You may
do so manually or follow its online instructions.

# Run `ngrok` process with multiple tunnels

Looking the pricing page of `ngrok`, it took me a while to understand their definition
of tunnel and process. For instance, these are the features for free accounts:

> - HTTP/TCP tunnels on random URLs/ports
> - 1 online ngrok process
> - 4 tunnels/ngrok process
> - 40 connections / minute

What the above means is that you can only have one `ngrok` process running in your
local machine, but in there you can have up to 4 tunnels. At first, I didn't know
how it works with executing this command `ngrok http <port>` because it means 1
tunnel per process. Afterwards, I found out in order to have multiple tunnels per
process, you need to configure that in its config file `~/.ngrok2/ngrok.yml` such as:

```yml
tunnels:
  server:
    addr: 8081
    proto: http
  web:
    addr: 8000
    proto: http
```

And then you shall be able to start them using either:

```sh
ngrok start server web
# or shorter
ngrok start --all
```
