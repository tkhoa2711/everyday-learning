# AWS queues
While looking for queuing products in AWS, I realize there're 2 services provided:
- SQS can be understood as a traditional *queue*. Messages are retrieved by consumers polling from the queue,
one consumer takes 1 message from the queue at a time.
- SNS follows *publish-subscribe* pattern, where messages are pushed to any number of subscribers at the time.
