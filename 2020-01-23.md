# Things I learnt about Django recently

- QuerySet's [`prefetch_related`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/querysets/#select-related)
  vs [`select_related`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/querysets/#prefetch-related):
  - `select_related` follows foreign-key relationship defined in the
    db model. It performs one database query with the `join` in it -
    this helps to avoid extra subsequent database queries. However, it
    only follows forward foreign keys and one-to-one relationship.
  - `prefetch_related` on the other hand does a separate database
    lookup for each relationship and "join" them together in Python.
    It works for many-to-many relationship and reverse foreign keys.

- A model's `Manager` is the interface through which database query
  operations are provided to Django models. The manager is mostly used
  to query objects of the given model class from the database.

- `QuerySet` is lazy

- Filter out entries in a `QuerySet`:
  
  ```python
  Model.objects.filter(name=...).exclude(id=...)
  ```
  
  or we can also do
  
  ```python
  Model.objects.filter( Q(name=...) & ~Q(id=...) )
  ```

- Create an empty `QuerySet` of a particular model with `Model.objects.none()`

- Customize the database table name for a given model (yes because sometimes
  the auto-generated name is just too convoluted)
  
  ```py
  class User(models.Model):
      class Meta:
          db_table = 'my_user_table'
  ```

- When you run `./manage.py makemigrations` for your new Django app and get
  error `No changes detected`. You need to use `./manage.py makemigrations <myapp>`
  instead. Also, the app need to be included in `INSTALLED_APPS`.

- To revert migrations done for an app:

  ```sh
  ./manage.py migrate <myapp> zero
  ```

- Sorting a form field (for a foreign key) in admin view without changing the
  other model's or model admin's ordering itself. An example would be the admin
  view for `Book` model that has a dropdown list to select the `Author`.

  ```py
  class BookAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
      def formfield_for_foreignkey(self, db_field, request, **kwargs):
          if db_field.name == "author":
              kwargs["queryset"] = Author.objects.all().order_by('name')
          return super(BookAdmin, self).formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, request, **kwargs)
  ```
