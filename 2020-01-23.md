# Things I learnt about Django recently

- QuerySet's [`prefetch_related`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/querysets/#select-related)
  vs [`select_related`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/querysets/#prefetch-related):
  - `select_related` follows foreign-key relationship defined in the
    db model. It performs one database query with the `join` in it -
    this helps to avoid extra subsequent database queries. However, it
    only follows forward foreign keys and one-to-one relationship.
  - `prefetch_related` on the other hand does a separate database
    lookup for each relationship and "join" them together in Python.
    It works for many-to-many relationship and reverse foreign keys.

- A model's `Manager` is the interface through which database query
  operations are provided to Django models. The manager is mostly used
  to query objects of the given model class from the database.

- `QuerySet` is lazy

- Filter out entries in a `QuerySet`:
  
  ```python
  Model.objects.filter(name=...).exclude(id=...)
  ```
  
  or we can also do
  
  ```python
  Model.objects.filter( Q(name=...) & ~Q(id=...) )
  ```

- Create an empty `QuerySet` of a particular model with `Model.objects.none()`
