# Python virtual environment tips

## Exit/deactivate a current active virtualenv

Run this in your shell:

```sh
deactivate
```

## Use `pyenv` to manage your python versions

[`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) could be a life
saver to reduce headache managing different python versions
on your machine. Install a new python version is simply:

```sh
pyenv install 3.8.1
```

You can also define the wanted version for a given directory
so that `pyenv` will switch to the correct python vesrsion
automatically. This is achieved by setting the desired version
in a file named `.python-version`. And add the below snippet
to your local `.bashrc`:

```bash
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then
  eval "$(pyenv init -)"
fi 
```
