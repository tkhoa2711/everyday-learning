# Print raw SQL queries to console in Django

```sh
python manage.py runserver_plus --print-sql
```

You can replace `runserver_plus` with other commands such as `shell_plus`. This
option is not available for the normal `runserver` or `shell` commands.

The default limit of printing the query is 1000 characters. If you wish to
increase the limit by setting `RUNSERVER_PLUS_PRINT_SQL_TRUNCATE = <limit>`.

# Recreate a docker container in docker-compose

There are times when I need to recreate the container (not just restart) so that
it starts off with a fresh state even without any change in the image.

```sh
docker-compose up -d --no-deps --force-recreate <service_name>
```

Quick explanation:
- `-d`: run the container in detached mode
- `--no-deps`: don't start/restart linked services
- `--force-recreate`: this is pretty self explanatory
