# Print raw SQL queries to console in Django

```sh
python manage.py runserver_plus --print-sql
```

You can replace `runserver_plus` with other commands such as `shell_plus`. This
option is not available for the normal `runserver` or `shell` commands.

The default limit of printing the query is 1000 characters. If you wish to
increase the limit by setting `RUNSERVER_PLUS_PRINT_SQL_TRUNCATE = <limit>`.
