# Squashing commits during git rebase

When using git to rebase from a branch to another branch, sometimes it
is desirable to "squash" certain commits together in order to maintain
a nice commit history. This is particular useful for experiment branches
where we would add a lot of trial and test commits.

- Start with `git rebase -i <branch>`
- You would see a list of commit starting with `pick`
- Keep `pick` for those you want them that way
- Change to `squash` for commits that need to be squashed. They will be
  "blended" together towards the first `pick`ed commit above them. You may
  also edit the commit message if needed.

  ```
  pick 02j8f3h finally it works
  squash 92jg84g 2nd attempt
  squash 1gi30fh try this new feature
  ```

There is also an interactive rebase tool for CLI available
https://github.com/MitMaro/git-interactive-rebase-tool. Here is its demo:
