# Things I learnt today with Heroku

-  Add existing Heroku app as a git remote

  ```sh
  heroku git:remote -a my-app-123
  ```

  To deploy code to the app using `git` (manually, instead of auto-deployment):

  ```sh
  git push heroku master
  ```

- Updating `app.json` for existing Heroku app doesn't take any effect. It only
  applies when a new app is created. This makes sense that it behaves this way
  to avoid unwanted side effects to production applications. For example, if an
  add-on is removed (perhaps accidentally), it's unlikely that Heroku should
  remove the add-on from your application and clear its data.

- Use [`heroku-buildpack-timestamps`](https://github.com/edmorley/heroku-buildpack-timestamps)
  to add timestamps to Heroku build logs and duration each buildpack takes. This
  is specifically useful for debugging build performance.

- View heroku builds details with [`heroku-builds`](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-builds)
  plugin.

  ```sh
  heroku builds:info -a my-app-123
  ```

  To show build output:

  ```sh
  heroku builds:output -a my-app-123
  ```
