# List available versions of a package on Debian

```sh

# or
apt list -a <package-name>

# Install curl on Debian

On a bare Debian system, installing curl will get you going with non-secured

can be bypassed with `-k` option, it's not recommended.

```sh
sudo apt-get install curl ca-certificates
```
