# Get the hash of the latest git commit

Long commit hash:

```sh
# plumbing style
git rev-parse HEAD

# porcelain style
git log -1 --format:'%H'
```

Short commit hash:

```sh
git rev-parse --short HEAD

git log -1 --format:'%h'
```

Another thing I learnt is `git` commands are divided into high level ("porcelain")
and low level ("plumbing") commands. A nice and down-to-earth analogy using a
toilet to represent the closeness to the users!
