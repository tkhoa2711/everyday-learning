# Versioning large files in Git using Git LFS

If anyone has used git, they probably know the best practices of keeping large
files or any artifacts outside the repository to keep it small. However in
certain cases it can be useful to track those files in the repository, such as
for demo or testing purposes.

Git Large File Storage (LFS) is an extension that replaces large files with
a reference to an external storage service. This allows you to store large files
outside the main repo.

To install Git LFS:

```sh
brew install git-lfs
git lfs install
```

To track large files:

```sh
git lfs track <large-file-name>
git add .gitattributes
```

After running `git lfs track`, a new file `.gitattributes` will be generated to
track those large files; we need to check it in as well. Afterwards, proceed to
commit as usual. Once pushed to GitHub or your own git server that supports LFS,
those files will be tracked in the server storage aside the main repo.
