# Setting precision level for timestamp field in MySQL

Remember to set precision level for timestamp field appropriately. The default
precision level is no fractional second.

```sql
CREATE TABLE test_table (
  timestamp_field TIMESTAMP(6) DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

Forgetting to set appropriate precision will cause problem down the line if you
are going to rely on mysql-generated timestamp for your application logic.
