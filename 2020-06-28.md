# The pain of renaming resources in Terraform

I love terraform, however due to the way it is designed to treat infrastructures
as immutable, there are certain things that is just a pain to manage in
terraform. Say, you want to rename the following:

```terraform
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "website" {
  ...
}
```

to:

```terraform
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "main_website" {
  ...
}
```

Running `terraform plan` and would you expect it nothing would change? Wrong.
Rename a resource will destroy the existing resource and create a
new one. Why? Because terraform treats resources as immutable!
  
In order to deal with this, you would have to use `terraform state mv` command
to manually move _each individual_ resource - and then rename them in your `.tf`
files afterwards.
