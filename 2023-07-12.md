# Delete secrets in AWS Secrets Manager immediately

By default, when you delete a secret via AWS Console or AWS CLI, Secrets Manager
doesn't immediately delete the secret. It is scheduled with a given grace period.
This can be a hassle if you actually want to just remove the secret straightaway.
The solution is to use AWS CLI with `--force-delete-without-recovery` option:

```sh
aws secretsmanager delete-secret --secret-id your-secret-name --force-delete-without-recovery --region your-region
```

Note that it is still an async process and may take awhile for the secret to be
completely deleted. Especially if you forgot to use this option in the beginning,
it can take a day or two.
