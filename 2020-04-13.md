# Things you can do with CircleCI cli locally

Validate CircleCI config:

```sh
circleci config validate
```

Validate and process/expand the full config:

```sh
circleci config process .circleci/config.yml
```

Execute a job on your local machine:

```sh
# if omitted, it will try to execute `build` job by default
circleci local execute [--job JOB_NAME]
```

# Supercharge git commands with `--patch` (or `-p`)

The most known usage is `git add -p` where we can interactively
select changes to stage. The same `-p|--patch` flag can be used
with `stash`, `checkout`

# Go vs Rust

A summary of what I spent 15 minutes researching the (obvious) difference between
Go and Rust programming languages. I haven't used neither of them so this is just
something for me to refer back to if I were to make the choice in the future.

> Go is fast, but Rust is faster.
>
> Go has an efficient garbage collector, but Rust has static memory management.
>
> Go has great concurrency support, but Rust has provably-correct concurrency.
>
> Go has interfaces, but Rust has traits and other zero-cost abstractions.

- Go is all about simplicity (_at scale_). It's what Google built to help it scales
  its services at _enterprise_ level.
- Rust is dead serious about _safety and security_ (for system programming)
