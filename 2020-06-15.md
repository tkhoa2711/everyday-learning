# Mocking object attributes in Python with Mockito

There is no straightforward way to mock attributes using `python-mockito`,
you would need to create a mock for the attribute and attach it to the object.
It's a bit ugly but this is how it is achieved:

```python
def test_mocking_attributes():
    prop = mock()
    when(prop).__get__(...).thenReturn(1)
    
    obj = mock({'prop': prop})
    
    assert obj.prop == 1
```

It would be great if we can do something more _pythonic_ such as:

```python
when(obj).__getattr__('prop').thenReturn(1)
```
