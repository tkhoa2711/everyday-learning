# Install extras with pip and poetry

Extras are variants of a package that contain support for additional features.
For example, `hypothesis[django]` install `hypothesis` with integration for
`django`. Here's how you would install extras:

```sh
pip install "package[extra]"
poetry add package -E extra
```
