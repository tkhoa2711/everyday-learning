# Inspect network request in React Native / Expo

Here's the magic code to see network requests in Chrome Devtools.

```js
GLOBAL.XMLHttpRequest = GLOBAL.originalXMLHttpRequest || GLOBAL.XMLHttpRequest;
```

However I still get weird console errors and unwanted response
with this approach. For example, I was getting error `Uncaught
Error: unsupported BodyInit type` when enabling the remote JS
debugging. Using the Expo's built-int network inspect tool provide
a much consistent result.
