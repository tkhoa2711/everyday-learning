# `count` vs `for_each` in Terraform

`count` allows you to iterate over a list of elements using an index.

`for_each` allows iteration with the elements' value itself. The only limitation
of `for_each` is that it can only be used for `map(string)` and `set(string)`
because it requires unique values by design.

This makes `for_each` a preferred choice where applicable since `count` will
destroy and recreate resources for any element whose index changes even if the
value is the same.
