# `Date.getTime()` vs `Date.parse()` to get timestamp of a given date string

There are two common ways to convert a date string into a timestamp in JavaScript: `Date.getTime()` and `Date.parse()`.

```ts
d = new Date("2025-03-29T02:10:30.234Z");
console.log(d.getTime()); // 1743214230234
console.log(Date.parse("2025-03-29T02:10:30.234Z")); // 171166743234
console.log(Date.parse(d)); // 1743214230000
```

They work exactly the same when given a same input string.

Only when passing a `Date` object to `Date.parse()`, it will return the timestamp of the date object rounded to the
nearest second. This is because `Date.parse()` is designed to parse strings, not `Date` objects.
