# Single-table design in DynamoDB

Benefits:

- The main reason for using a single table in DynamoDB is to retrieve multiple,
  heterogenous item types using a single request

Drawbacks:

- Steep learning curve
- Only optimised for the know access patterns at the time. Handling new access
  patterns can be tricky
- Analytics. DynamoDB is designed for OLTP use cases

When _not_ to use single-table design:

- When query flexibility is needed, especially with new applications or when
  usage patterns are not yet well known
  - This is true for most generic applications, where performance is not the first
    concern
  - Applications using GraphQL
