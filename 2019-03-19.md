# Git push up to a certain commit
I found myself in this situation often: I need to push only up to a certain commits to the remote,
while holding off the rest - for whatever reason. The following command allows me to do exactly that:

```
git push <remote> <commit-hash>:<branch>
```

So we can do something like this:

```
git push origin a1296d1ad8e5df293a85fd6bbf13504bc04d4f34:master
```

# Cherry pick a specific commit from a different repo
First, we need to add the other repo as a `remote` of the current project:

```
git remote add <remote-name> <remote-url>
git fetch <remote-name>
```

Then, we can cherry-pick any commit to the current repo:

```
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```
