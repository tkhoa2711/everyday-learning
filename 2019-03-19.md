# Git push up to a certain commit
I found myself in this situation often: I need to push only up to a certain commits to the remote,
while holding off the rest - for whatever reason. The following command allows me to do exactly that:

```
git push <remote> <commit-hash>:<branch>
```

So we can do something like this:

```
git push origin a1296d1ad8e5df293a85fd6bbf13504bc04d4f34:master
```
