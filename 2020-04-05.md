# Optimize building Docker images

## Use a small base image if possible

Sometimes, `alpine`-based image is enough. If not, opt for `slim` or a
trimmed-down version before using the full version.

## Utilizing layer caching by rearranging order of commands

The rule of thumb is: instructions should be order by their chance of being
modified from the least to the most whenever possible. For example:
- Update system (e.g. `apt-get update`) and install system-wide dependencies
  before installing application-level dependencies
- Add dependency lock files (e.g. `yarn.lock`) and install the dependencies
  first before adding the rest of the source code

## Reduce the number of layers

In a `Dockerfile`, `RUN`, `ADD` and `COPY` are the 3 instructions that create a
new layer for the docker image. In order to reduce the number of layers created,
it's _often_ better to group related instructions together:

```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y git && \
    # and something else
```

## Don't forget `.dockerignore`

This is often overlooked, however you might be able to speed up the build a
lot by ignoring irrelevant files that are sent to the build context.

## Multi-stage build

Use a separate disposable image to install and build the application, then only
take what you need during runtime to the final image.

## BONUS: `ONBUILD` instruction

The `ONBUILD` instruction works as a trigger that is meant to be executed at a
later time when the image is used by another downstream build. This feature can
be used to create reusable `Dockerfile` templates among different applications
or projects.
