# PostgreSQL schema and search path

In Postgres, named _schemas_ are used to group tables and other related objects
together logically. They can be used to organize data with encapsulation and
potentially security implications.

Their use cases:
- To organize data in logical groups
- Allow multiple users to use one database without interfering with each other

`public` is the default schema that will be used by default if one is not
specified.

There is a concept of _schema search path_ which determines how the database
resolves an unqualified table name to a schema. It basically traverse the search
path in order to find one with the given table.

```sql
SHOW search_path;
```

The default search path is:

```
postgres=# SHOW search_path;
   search_path
-----------------
 "$user", public
(1 row)
```

Schema and search path can be leveraged to perform zero-downtime database
migrations such as [changing column names](https://fabianlindfors.se/blog/schema-migrations-in-postgres/).
