# Running Terraform on CI servers

To provide variables to terraform commands such as `plan` and `run`, instead
of using a `.tfvars` file, you can either:

- Use a wrapper script and supply the terraform command with `-var"=key=value"`
- Use environment variables with `TF_VAR_` prefix, for example `TF_VAR_key`
  will define the value for `key` variable. This is my preferred way since it
  most (if not all) CI tools support environment variables out of the box, and
  you don't need to write a custom script.

It's also a good idea to set `TF_INPUT` environment to `false` or `0` to stop
terraform from asking for inputs like it would normally do on your local shell.
Terraform also recommends setting `TF_IN_AUTOMATION` to any non-empty value so
it would adjust its output to be more appropriate for such environment.
