# Power-up daily `git` usage with `tig`

Recently, a colleague introduces me to [`tig`](https://jonas.github.io/tig/).
It is an text-based interface for git that can be used conveniently
in a terminal. And to be honest, the first experience is pretty
impressive, even though there's a few commands you need to know
to navigate around and perform actions.
