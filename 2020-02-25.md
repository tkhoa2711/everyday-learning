# Power-up daily `git` usage with `tig`

Recently, a colleague introduces me to [`tig`](https://jonas.github.io/tig/).
It is an text-based interface for git that can be used conveniently
in a terminal. And to be honest, the first experience is pretty
impressive, even though there's a few commands you need to know
to navigate around and perform actions.

## Stage changes interactively

I have been a fan of `git add -p` lately due to the versatility it
offers. With `tig`, I can do the same think and even more by either
selecting a hunk or an individual line in a hunk itself.

In `stage` view, go to the `Changes not staged for commit` section:

- <kbd>u</kbd> stage the whole hunk
- <kbd>1</kbd> stage the current line

To unstage some changes:, go to `Changes to be committed` section:

- <kbd>1</kbd> unstage the specific line
- <kbd>!</kbd> unstage the whole hunk (WARNING: the change will be
gone forever with this)
