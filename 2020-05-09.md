# Extra helpful git commands with `git-extras`

[`git-extras`](https://github.com/tj/git-extras) is a collection of
several useful `git` scripts to facilitate certain tasks. A couple
of examples are:

- `git ignore`: add files or directories to `.gitignore` without
opening the text editor
- `git missing`: show which commits are on one branch or the other but
not both
- `git pr`: checkout a pull request from GitHub
