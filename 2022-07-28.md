# Running Puppeteer on Alpine Docker

```Dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine

ENV CHROME_BIN="/usr/bin/chromium-browser" \
    PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD="true"

RUN apk update \
    && apk upgrade \
    && apk add --no-cache \
    udev \
    ttf-freefont \
    chromium

RUN mkdir /app
WORKDIR /app

# For demonstration purpose only, in real life you may have puppeteer as a direct
# dependency in your package.json for example
RUN npm install -g puppeteer

ADD . .

CMD [ "node", "index.js" ]
```

The `puppeteer` script `index.js` may look something like:

```js
import puppeteer from "puppeteer";

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    // Comment this out if you wish to see it in action when running locally
    // headless: false,
    // Don't use the default 800x600 view port
    defaultViewport: null,
    // Use the custom Chrome binary if available, otherwise use the default one
    // from the system. This is to cater for both running on Docker and running
    // directly without Docker (many people may choose to do this).
    executablePath: process.env.CHROME_BIN ?? "",
  });

  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto("https://google.com");

  await browser.close();
})();
```
