# Remove unwanted files from previous commit (given it's not pushed yet)

Given that you've just mistakenly included some files in your last commit.
Do a soft reset:

```
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

Then you can remove unwanted files:

```
git reset HEAD <file>
```

Or make any other modifications as needed.

Finally, commit the change with:

```
git commit --amend
```
