# Improve historical commands search with `hstr`

While most of us are familiar with <kbd>C-r</kbd> for searching previous used commands
in the history. [`hstr`](https://dvorka.github.io/hstr/) provided an enhanced
terminal-based UI where you can easily navigate, view and (obviously) search
the command history.

It is available for both `bash` and `zsh` on various OS.
