# Improve historical commands search with `hstr`

While most of us are familiar with <kbd>C-r</kbd> for searching previous used commands
in the history. [`hstr`](https://dvorka.github.io/hstr/) provided an enhanced
terminal-based UI where you can easily navigate, view and (obviously) search
the command history.

It is available for both `bash` and `zsh` on various OS.

# Fix `powerline` font color when using `zsh` in PyCharm terminal

If the font is broken in your PyCharm terminal, go to `Editor ->Color Scheme -> Console Font`.
Otherwise, if the colors look off, especially when text color appears white
with a light background - or vice versa, dark text color with dark background -
you can go to `Console Colors` following the same path as the previous one.
Here is what it was for me before the fix:

![Before](./images/zsh-on-pycharm-before.png)

In my case, it is as simple as switching the ANSI color codes for black and
white i.e. switching their hex values.

![After](./images/zsh-on-pycharm-after.png)

Feel free to customize further to suit your needs, you always have the option to revert
to default settings.
