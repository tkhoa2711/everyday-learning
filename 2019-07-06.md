# Unable to install dependencies from private GitHub repo

One day, `yarn` is denied access to fetch from a private repo in my GitHub account.

```
Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
```

Having tried all the suggestions from here https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/4360
but no luck. It turns out that I didn't have my SSH key added to my GitHub account,
which is strange because I've both use my current Macbook Air and GitHub together for years.

Anyway, follow the steps from here https://help.github.com/en/articles/error-permission-denied-publickey
to add new SSH key to GitHub. In my case, I just need to add the existing `id_rsa` key from my
local machine.
