# Using `vuetify`'s stepper component with Vue router
Usually, the common usage of vue router is to have a `<router-view/>` component in your main application component `App.vue`.
However, with `v-stepper`. it places each of the view inside the `v-stepper-content`:

```vue
<v-stepper-step step="1">
  Step 1
</v-stepper-step>
<v-stepper-content step="1">
  <step-1/>
</v-stepper-content>

<v-stepper-step step="2">
  Step 2
</v-stepper-step>
<v-stepper-content step="2">
  <step-2/>
</v-stepper-content>
```

This implementation assumes loading all step content components at once.
It could pose a problem if user navigates back and forth between steps,
and changes some inputs which require component re-rendering.
Here's how to achieve that:

```vue
<v-stepper-step step="1">
  Step 1
</v-stepper-step>
<v-stepper-content step="1">
  <router-view/>
</v-stepper-content>

<v-stepper-step step="2">
  Step 2
</v-stepper-step>
<v-stepper-content step="2">
  <router-view/>
</v-stepper-content>
```

This genius trick allows us to achieve stepping through each steps with the URL
reflecting the current step as well.
