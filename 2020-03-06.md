# Resolve git merge conflict with `git mergetool`

Add the following to your `.gitconfig`:

```ini
[merge]
    tool = vimdiff
    conflictstyle = diff3
    prompt = false
```

After this, when there is a merge conflict, you can use `git mergetool`
to resolve the conflict from commandline. Depends on which tool is
configured, you may get a graphical or terminal-based UI after running
the previous command. Personally, I use `vimdiff` so that it can be
run anywhere.

```
+--------------------------------+
| LOCAL  |     BASE     | REMOTE |
+--------------------------------+
|             MERGED             |
+--------------------------------+
```

This is a great small example/tutorial to try out `git mergetool`

The first impression wasn't great for me as I've got some weird color
scheme on the diff view. Also it's hard to navigate around and perform
actions if you didn't know the keyboard shortcuts.

## Abort the merge (especially if you're experimenting)

Run `:cquit` to abort the merge within the diff view. If you just run
the normal `:q` command, `git` will consider the conflict was resolved
(given you had `merge.prompt` set to `false`).

## Different color scheme for diff view

In your `.vimrc`:

```vim
if &diff
    colorscheme some_other_scheme
endif
```
