# `Error` vs `Fatal` in Go

In Go's `testing` package, there are 2 options to to report and signal test
failure at the same time: `Error` and `Fatal` (and their variants like `Errorf`).
To put it simple:

- `Fatal` reports the error and stop the execution immediately
- `Error` marks the test as failed but will allow the test to continue to run.
  This can be useful if there's a possibility to get more information for
  debugging the failure.
