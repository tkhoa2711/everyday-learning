# Run Django shell interactively with `ipython`

This allows you to interact with Django using the shell:

```sh
python manage.py shell -i ipython
```

## Hot reload imported modules in the shell

If you've already imported some modules and would like to
reload it after you changed the source code:

```py
import importlib
importlib.reload(mymodule)
```
