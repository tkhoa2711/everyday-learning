## `unknown` vs `any`

> [..] unknown which is the type-safe counterpart of any. Anything is assignable
  to unknown, but unknown isn't assignable to anything but itself and any without
  a type assertion or a control flow based narrowing. Likewise, no operations are
  permitted on an unknown without first asserting or narrowing to a more specific
  type.

Example:

```ts
let vAny: any = 10;          // We can assign anything to any
let vUnknown: unknown =  10; // We can assign anything to unknown just like any


let s1: string = vAny;     // Any is assignable to anything
let s2: string = vUnknown; // Invalid; we can't assign vUnknown to any other type (without an explicit assertion)

vAny.method();     // Ok; anything goes with any
vUnknown.method(); // Not ok; we don't know anything about this variable
```
