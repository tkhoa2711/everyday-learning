# Allow local Rails servers to accept requests from public

Add the following to `config/environments/development.rb` file:

```rb
Rails.application.configure do
  # ...

  # add this if you're using (free) ngrok for local tunnel
  config.hosts << /.*\.ngrok-free\.app/
end
```

If you're using CLI tools like `curl`, don't forget to add the necessary headers
especially if you're calling JSON endpoints. Otherwise, you'd get back an empty
response.

```
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
```

# Get current/past/future unix timestamps on macOS

```sh
# current timestamp
date +%s

# past/future timestamp
# yesterday
date -v-1d +%s
# in 1 hour
date -v+1H +%s
```

`-d` option isn't available in macOS e.g. `date -d '+1 hour'`.
