# Use `poetry` in `Dockerfile`

```Dockerfile
RUN curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python

# for root user
ENV PATH "$PATH:/root/.poetry/bin"

# for non-root user
# NOTE:
# - $HOME is not set by default, you'll need to set its value if you wish to use
#   it instead of '/home/$USER'
# - '~' also won't be expanded automatically
ENV PATH "$PATH:/home/$USER/.poetry/bin"
```

Another alternative is to execute the `$HOME/.poetry/env` file, but it is only
effective within the same `RUN` command:

```Dockerfile
# you can use `source` instead of `.` but that only works if the shell is `bash`
RUN . $HOME/.poetry/env && poetry install
```
