# Migrate from Bitwarden to 1Password

I've been trying to love Bitwarden but couldn't get over its bad UX. If only it could work and integrate with other
tools smoothly :(

A utility called `mrc-converter-suite` is available to import exported data from other password managers into 1Password.
The tool is available [here](https://1password.community/discussion/101693/moving-to-1password-from-another-password-manager#latest).
