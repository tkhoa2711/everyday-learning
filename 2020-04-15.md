# Ongoing issues with using Expo ecosystem

After spending 3 years of doing ocassional work on my side project using
React Native/Expo, I've learnt that 90% of the problems occur when project
is unable to start, the Expo client app having problems loading the app
and similar stuff - they can be solved by upgrading either the CLI tool,
the SDK, the app, or all of the above.

Even though I admire React Native for what it can do, Expo makes me feel
like I can't rely on it to build and compile my code after a few months
without upgrading something.
