# Launch VS Code from command line with ease

Open the command palette with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>
and type `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH` then <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
Start a new terminal or restart existing one for the change to take effect.

Then you should be able to open a folder in VS Code easily with
`code /path/to/folder`.
