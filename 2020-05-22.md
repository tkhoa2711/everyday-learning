# Run private Docker registry with AWS S3 backend

Recently, I need to backup a couple of private Docker images to AWS S3. S3 is
cheap and reliable for such purpose. Only at this point I realized that I don't
know where a Docker image is stored and is there anyway just to copy the Docker
image as a "file" (turns out later that it's super simple) and upload it to S3.
So I thought maybe I could run a private Docker registry that use S3 as it
storage backend.

Docker provides an image of the Docker registry so people can run their own
hosted registry without relying on third party services. We use AWS ECR at work
but to be honest we aren't 100% sure on it.

Assuming your AWS credential has sufficient access to S3. If not, you can create
a new IAM role with the following permission policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:GetBucketLocation",
        "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::S3_BUCKET_NAME"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts",
        "s3:AbortMultipartUpload"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::S3_BUCKET_NAME/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

To run your private registry:

```sh
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 \
-e "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" \
-e "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" \
-e "REGISTRY_STORAGE=s3" \
-e "REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_REGION=$AWS_REGION" \
-e "REGISTRY_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET=bucket-name" \
-e "REGISTRY_STORAGE_CACHE_BLOBDESCRIPTOR=inmemory" \
--name registry \
registry:2
```

Tag and push your image to the regis

```sh
docker image tag my-image localhost:5000/my-image
docker push localhost:5000/my-image
```

# Save a Docker image to a file

The simpler way of backing up your Docker images without running a full private
regisrty is to save them to files - which is supported natively by Docker itself.
As simple as that. Somehow it's too simple that I didn't think of it in the beginning.

```sh
docker save -o my-image.tar my-image:latest
```

You can also use `gzip` to compress the archive:

```sh
docker save my-image:latest | gzip > my-image.tar.gz
```

To load the image again:

```sh
docker load -i my-image.tar
```
