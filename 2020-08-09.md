# Host static website on S3 with CNAME for a custom domain

I've been setting up static websites and assets on S3 with the following pattern
`Cloudflare -> CloudFront -> S3`. While it works really well, I've been wondering
if I could omit CloudFront from the chain given that Cloudflare is a good CDN
by itself and it could do pretty much anything CloudFront does.

Turns out it's possible, and not as simple as it looks. There are a couple of
things you might need to configure but the most important part is configuring
the CNAME for DNS. In short, if you'd like to host your static website at a
subdomain of your custom domain such as https://my-subdomain.my-domain.com, the
S3 bucket name must be named **exactly** that i.e. `my-subdomain.my-domain.com`.

# Cache anything when building docker images locally

Docker's new build system, BuildKit, brings a lot useful features into the build
process. I've mentioned the build secrets previously, this time it's all about
caching. And I'm not talking about docker build caching with layers, it's more
about caching things specific to your image or project. An example would be the
`node_modules` or `pip` cache.

I'm working on a few Python projects that we've just migrated to use Docker for
local development that went really smoothly. However, whenever there's a change
in the dependencies, rebuilding the Docker image takes ages since every packages
are installed from scratch.

Having used `--mount=type=ssh` previously, I've only found out that there are
other mount types as well. One of them is `cache` which specifically addresses
the issue we're facing.

The syntax is self-explanatory:

```Dockerfile
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/pip pip install -r requirements.txt
```

With this, subsequent docker build time on local machine is significant lower.

Nonetheless, it has the same problem with the ssh mount where you will need to
add the user's UID for a non-root user.

```Dockerfile
# Assuming we already created this user prior to this with UID 1001
USER docker

RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/home/docker/.cache/pip,uid=1001 \
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note that you can't use environment variables within the `mount` argument yet
due to an existing bug in BuildKit https://github.com/moby/buildkit/issues/815.

Also, don't use `--force-rm` option in your `docker build` command. I had this
previously when I was still manually passing the SSH key to an intermediate
container to fetch private repositories. That option removes the caches between
builds.

# Logging and CI-friendly output for the new docker build system

With BuildKit and the new frontend `# syntax = docker/dockerfile:experimental`,
while providing a better experience on the terminal, it does not play well with
CI and for logging purpose when you need to investigate the full build log.

Solution: use `--progress=plain` option in your `docker build` command.
