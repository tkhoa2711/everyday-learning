# Host static website on S3 with CNAME for a custom domain

I've been setting up static websites and assets on S3 with the following pattern
`Cloudflare -> CloudFront -> S3`. While it works really well, I've been wondering
if I could omit CloudFront from the chain given that Cloudflare is a good CDN
by itself and it could do pretty much anything CloudFront does.

Turns out it's possible, and not as simple as it looks. There are a couple of
things you might need to configure but the most important part is configuring
the CNAME for DNS. In short, if you'd like to host your static website at a
subdomain of your custom domain such as https://my-subdomain.my-domain.com, the
S3 bucket name must be named **exactly** that i.e. `my-subdomain.my-domain.com`.
