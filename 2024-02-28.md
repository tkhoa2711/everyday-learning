# Fetch a field conditionally in GraphQL

## Duplicate a table in PostgreSQL

```sh
CREATE TABLE new_table_name AS TABLE old_table_name [WITH NO DATA|WITH DATA];
```

This approaches copies the table with or without the data

```sh
CREATE TABLE new_table_name (LIKE old_table_name INCLUDING ALL);
```

This method however does not copy foreign-key constraints and triggers.

I find that the most reliable option is to leverage any tools available such as
[pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) or [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) to
generate corresponding creation sql queries.
