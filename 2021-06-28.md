# Run SSH tunnel in the background

Don't use `&`.

```sh
ssh -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -fN -L <local-port>:<remote-host>:<remote-port> <username>@<ssh-host>
```

Some details:

> If the ExitOnForwardFailure configuration option is set to "yes", then a client
  started with -f will wait for all remote port forwards to be successfully
  established before placing itself in the background.

> -N Do not execute a remote command.  This is useful for just for-warding ports
  (protocol version 2 only).
