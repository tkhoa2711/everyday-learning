# Run SSH tunnel in the background

Don't use `&`.

```sh
ssh -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -fN -L <local-port>:<remote-host>:<remote-port> <username>@<ssh-host>
```

Some details:

> If the ExitOnForwardFailure configuration option is set to "yes", then a client
  started with -f will wait for all remote port forwards to be successfully
  established before placing itself in the background.

> -N Do not execute a remote command.  This is useful for just for-warding ports
  (protocol version 2 only).

# Configure nginx for AWS ELB health check

```conf
server {
  location /elb-health-check {
    access_log off;
    return 200 'OK';
    add_header Content-Type text/plain;
  }
}
```

The extra header allow us to check the endpoint via browsers conveniently. By
default the `Content-Type` will be `application/octet-stream` that normally
prompts the browser to ask for downloading content as a file.
