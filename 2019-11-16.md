# Multiple accounts with heroku cli
If you have multiple accounts with Heroku (e.g personal and work),
it's a pain to keep logging out and in to switch between accounts.
In that case, this plugin [heroku-accounts](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-accounts)
would be a worthy addition to cli setup.

```
heroku accounts:add personal|work|side_project
```

Use `--sso` option if you need to authenticate via SSO.
