# Multiple accounts with heroku cli
If you have multiple accounts with Heroku (e.g personal and work),
it's a pain to keep logging out and in to switch between accounts.
In that case, this plugin [heroku-accounts](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-accounts)
would be a worthy addition to cli setup.

```
heroku accounts:add personal|work|side_project
```

Use `--sso` option if you need to authenticate via SSO.

# SSL with Heroku and Cloudflare
While Cloudflare provides free SSL certificates, if your application server
is hosted on Heroku and you wish to encrypt traffic between Cloudflare
and your host (Heroku), you would need to use paid dynos.
