# Partially commit a file in git
I've always like PyCharm because they have a feature that allow user
to preview and select a few chunks of current change to commit.
Only now that I know it's actually a git's own functionality -
interactive staging.

It can be achieved by:

```
git add -p <filename>
```

Then you get to interactively decide what to do with each _"hunk"_
(that Git perceives as a sensible portion of the change in that file).

Here're some useful commands for quick reference:

- <kbd>y</kbd> stage this hunk for the next commit
- <kbd>n</kbd> do not stage this hunk for the next commit
- <kbd>q</kbd> quit; do not stage this hunk or any of the remaining hunks
- <kbd>a</kbd> stage this hunk and all later hunks in the file
- <kbd>d</kbd> do not stage this hunk or any of the later hunks in the file
- <kbd>g</kbd> select a hunk to go to
- <kbd>/</kbd> search for a hunk matching the given regex
- <kbd>j</kbd> leave this hunk undecided, see next undecided hunk
- <kbd>k</kbd> leave this hunk undecided, see previous undecided hunk
- <kbd>s</kbd> split the current hunk into smaller hunks
- <kbd>e</kbd> manually edit the current hunk
- <kbd>e</kbd> print hunk help
