# Testing HTTP logic with `httptest` in Go

`httptest` is a little hidden gem in Go standard library that allows you to perform
various testing with HTTP e.g. testing your custom HTTP server, making a fake
HTTP request to test your HTTP handler function.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "io"
  "net/http/httptest"
  "testing"
)

func TestHTTPHandlerFunc(t *testing.T) {
  // setup the a test GET request and pass it to the corresponding context object
  w := httptest.NewRecorder()
  req := httptest.NewRequest("GET", "http://looney.tunes/test-url", nil)
  ctx := hhh.NewContext(w, req)

  // trigger the HTTP handler function with the fabricated context
  err := YourHTTPHandlerFunc(ctx)

  // read and assert the result
  resp := w.Result()
  if resp.StatusCode != 200 {
    t.Errorf("Expected status code 200, got %d", resp.StatusCode)
  }

  // check the response body
  body, _ := io.ReadAll(resp.Body)
  fmt.Println(string(body))
}
```

# Compare different ways to intialize slices in Go

```go
var firstSlice []int
secondSlice := []int{}
```

They are mostly equivalent, with no allocation involved. However functionally,
the main difference when using them with JSON, especially JSON API, is that
`firstSlice` will be marshalled as `"null"` whereas `secondSlice` will be marshalled
as an empty array `"[]"`. Your API clients need to be aware of this difference
and be able to handle all possible returned values.
