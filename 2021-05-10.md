# Ignore an already versioned file in git

One use case if this feature is ignoring files similar to `.env.local` where
you may have some instructions or examples in the file but would not want to
track subsequent changes to that file going forward.

> Once you mark a file like this, Git completely ignores any changes on it. It
> will never show up when running git status or git diff, nor will it ever be
> committed.

```sh
git update-index --assume-unchanged path/to/file
```

# Interactive shell with Docker compose

There will be times where you need to keep your docker container running in order
to login into it and debug issues or execute further commands. Usually, starting
a container with `docker-compose` executes its defined command and it then exits
immediately. It can be prevented with:

```yml
version: "3"

services:
  app:
    image: image-name:tag
    stdin_open: true # docker run -i
    tty: true        # docker run -t
```
