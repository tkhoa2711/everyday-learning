# What I didn't know about YAML

## Anchors and references

YAML has anchors and references to DRY-up your config:

```yml
foo: &foo
  value

bar: *foo
```

The above will result in:

```yml
foo: value
bar: value
```

## Objects are extendable

```yml
foo: &foo
  key1: "value1"
  key2: "value2"

bar:
  <<: *foo
  key2: "value2 changed"
  key3: "value3"
```

The above can be fully extended into:

```yml
foo:
  key1: "value1"
  key2: "value2"

bar:
  key1: "value1"
  key2: "value2 changed"
  key3: "value3"
```
