# Upgrade indirect dependencies with Yarn

I'll take my situation where there was an existing CVE for `node-forge<0.10.0`
but it wasn't a direct dependency of my application i.e. it wasn't listed in
`package.json` file.

```sh
# check why a package is installed, by whom and its resolved version(s)
$ yarn why node-forge

...
=> Found "node-forge@0.9.0"
info Reasons this module exists
   - Hoisted from "@vue#cli-service#webpack-dev-server#selfsigned@node-forge"
...
```

We could see that it was installed because of `@vue/cli-service`.

There are two ways (that I know of) to solve this:

1. Modify `yarn.lock` manually
   - Delete the whole entry (`node-forge`) in `yarn.lock`
   - Run `yarn` and the indirect dependencies and any affected packages will be
     updated

   Instead of `node-forge` I could actually delete `selfsigned` since this package
   has been updated with the desired `node-forge` version. After re-running `yarn`
   both of them will be updated correctly.

2. Use `resolutions` entry in `package.json`
   - Add the following to `package.json`:

     ```json
     "resolutions": {
       "@vue/cli-service/**/node-forge": "^0.10.0"
     }
     ```
   - Run `yarn` and we're good to go
   - If you wish to keep the original `package.json`, you can `git restore` it
     and run `yarn` again so that the final change to commit will be the updated
     `node-forge` in `yarn.lock`
