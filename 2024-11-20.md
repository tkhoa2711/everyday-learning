# Choose a merge strategy for a given file during rebase

In some cases, we don't care about a given change, whether "ours" or "theirs", so we just
want to pick one and discard the other. I find this common with npm or yarn lock files
where I just want to discard the changes and generate a new lock file after the rebase.

```sh
git checkout --ours -- <paths>
```

In a rebase operation, `ours` refers the branch we are rebasing from, usually `master` or
`main`; `theirs` refers to the current branch. Whereas in a merge, their meanings are
reversed.
