# Upsert on Postgres

```sql
insert into ... on conflict do nothing/update
```

This approach alleviate potential race condition with this alternative:

```sql
insert into ... where not exists (...)
```

However it does come with caveats that we need to look out for, especially if
we want to update the row on conflict.
