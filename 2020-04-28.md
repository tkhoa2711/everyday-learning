# Fixing problems installing/using `postgresql` with `psycopg2` on Mac

I recently installed something with `homebrew` that bumped my `openssl` from `1.0` to
`1.1`. And suddenly I can't run my Django application anymore:

```sh
...
dyld: Library not loaded libssl.1.0.0.dylib
...
```

The solution for me is to reinstall `postgresql` (which also comes with the postgresql
driver). There are other suggestions such as reinstall `libpq` which is just the
driver itself, or `psycopg2-binary`.

You may need to provide the linking flags during installation. Please note I have
`openssl` symlinked to `openssl@1.1` for the below:

```sh
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include"
```
