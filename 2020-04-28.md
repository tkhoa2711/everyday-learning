strings /path/to/document.pdf | grep -i FontName
```

If you're using Windows:

# Split a PDF file in Mac

While there are multiple ways to split a PDF file, I'm looking for one that is able
to keep its original structure as much as possible. This is because I'm debugging an
issue where the fonts used in the PDF are not embedded there. Here is the list of
things I tried to extract 1 page out of it:

- Use default system print dialog
- Open with Preview and use `Save As`, `Export As` with the selected page
- Use browsers such as Chrome
- Drag and drop a page from Preview to Desktop

And only this work:

- Delete the other pages in Preview and save the current file

There are other CLI tools such as `poppler` (available via Homebrew) but it seems to
be a sizable package that I didn't attempt to install just for this task.

# Fixing problems installing/using `postgresql` with `psycopg2` on Mac

I recently installed something with `homebrew` that bumped my `openssl` from `1.0` to
`1.1`. And suddenly I can't run my Django application anymore:

```sh
...
dyld: Library not loaded libssl.1.0.0.dylib
...
```

The solution for me is to reinstall `postgresql` (which also comes with the postgresql
driver). There are other suggestions such as reinstall `libpq` which is just the
driver itself, or `psycopg2-binary`.

You may need to provide the linking flags during installation. Please note I have
`openssl` symlinked to `openssl@1.1` for the below:

```sh
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include"
```

# Use SSH with AWS SSM

I love AWS Session Manager, it's such a great tool that eliminate all the hassles
of SSH keys, bastion hosts. I can log into any instance without specifying any SSH
key pairs.

```sh
aws ssm start-session <instance-id>
```

Today I learnt that you can use SSH over SSM so that you can use tools like `scp`
that leverages SSH itself. This is what you need for your `~/.ssh/config`:

```sshconfig
# SSH over Session Manager
host i-* mi-*
    ProxyCommand sh -c "aws ssm start-session --target %h --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters 'portNumber=%p'"
```

Depends on your IAM user's roles, you may need to add a policy to use SSH through
SSM.

The downside is that you would need to provide a key associated with that instance
you are logging into `ssh -i /path/to/key.pem user@instance-id`. I have yet to find
a perfect solution to this, especially when I don't have the key to the instance.
