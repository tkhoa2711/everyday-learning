# Split a PDF file in Mac

While there are multiple ways to split a PDF file, I'm looking for one that is able
to keep its original structure as much as possible. This is because I'm debugging an
issue where the fonts used in the PDF are not embedded there. Here is the list of
things I tried to extract 1 page out of it:

- Use default system print dialog
- Open with Preview and use `Save As`, `Export As` with the selected page
- Use browsers such as Chrome
- Drag and drop a page from Preview to Desktop

And only this work:

- Delete the other pages in Preview and save the current file

There are other CLI tools such as `poppler` (available via Homebrew) but it seems to
be a sizable package that I didn't attempt to install just for this task.

# Fixing problems installing/using `postgresql` with `psycopg2` on Mac

I recently installed something with `homebrew` that bumped my `openssl` from `1.0` to
`1.1`. And suddenly I can't run my Django application anymore:

```sh
...
dyld: Library not loaded libssl.1.0.0.dylib
...
```

The solution for me is to reinstall `postgresql` (which also comes with the postgresql
driver). There are other suggestions such as reinstall `libpq` which is just the
driver itself, or `psycopg2-binary`.

You may need to provide the linking flags during installation. Please note I have
`openssl` symlinked to `openssl@1.1` for the below:

```sh
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include"
```
