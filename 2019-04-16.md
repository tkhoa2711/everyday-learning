# Domain-Driven Design
Bounded context helps defining the domains of a system that can further be developed with
microservice architecture.

The essence of each service or subsystem is that it should encapsulate and focus on a single
domain - not the features or functionalities.

# Event sourcing architecture, CQRS
- Each `event stream - projector - projection` should only serve 1 purpose
- The `command` side of CQRS is more important than the `query` side. Messing up the design of commands i.e. event definitions, event stores - might cause devastating effect in the long term
