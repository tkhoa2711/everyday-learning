# Cherry pick a range of commits from one branch to another

This is how to `cherry-pick` commits ranging from `A` to `B` from another branch
to the current branch:

```sh
git cherry-pick A^..B
```

Note that `A` should be the older commit. We need `A^` to include the commit `A`
itself in the list.
