# Check if a file exists in Go

```go
if _, err := os.Stat(filename); errors.Is(err, os.ErrNotExist) {
  // file does not exist
} else {
  // file exists
}
```

However, this approach has some caveats. After the `os.Stat` is called, it could
be possible the file would be renamed, deleted, etc before we attempt to do
some operations on the file. This approach is acceptable if we only attempt to
check for the file existence.

If we want to check the file exists and then open it, it's better to do this:

```go
file, err := os.OpenFile(filename)
if errors.Is(err, os.ErrNotExist) {
  // handle the situation where file doesn't exist
} else if err != nil {
  // other types of error
}
```

# How to host private NPM packages on GitHub

## Set up access to GitHub Packages

Obtain a new (or existing) GitHub access token in order to download and/or
publish to GitHub Packages. The token must at least have `read:packages` access,
and `write:packages` if you wish to grant it publish permission as well.

Add the following to your `~/.npmrc` file:

```ini
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
@org-name:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

Verify that you can authenticate with GitHub Packages:

```sh
$ npm whoami --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
your_github_username
```

## Prepare your project to be published

Your `package.json` should look like this:

```json
{
  "name": "@org-name/package-name",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "repository": "git://github.com/org-name/package-name",
  "license": "UNLICENSED",
  "files": [
    "files-to-be-included"
  ],
  "publishConfig": {
    "registry":"https://npm.pkg.github.com/"
  }
}
```

There are a few important details here:

- `name` must be prefixed with the organisation weâ€™re publishing to
- `repo` must point to the same repo URL using this format such as
  `git://github.com/org-name/package-name`
- `license` should be `UNLICENSED` to indicate a private package
- `publishConfig` indicates which registry the package should be uploaded to
- `files` describes which files to be included in the package using glob pattern

Then you should be able to publish the package with:

```sh
npm publish
```

## Install the private package

With `~/.npmrc` already set up as previously, we can install the private package
with either `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add @org-name/@package-name
```

or `npm`:

```sh
npm install @org-name/@package-name
```
