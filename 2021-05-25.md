# Check if a file exists in Go

```go
if _, err := os.Stat(filename); errors.Is(err, os.ErrNotExist) {
  // file does not exist
} else {
  // file exists
}
```

However, this approach has some caveats. After the `os.Stat` is called, it could
be possible the file would be renamed, deleted, etc before we attempt to do
some operations on the file. This approach is acceptable if we only attempt to
check for the file existence.

If we want to check the file exists and then open it, it's better to do this:

```go
file, err := os.OpenFile(filename)
if errors.Is(err, os.ErrNotExist) {
  // handle the situation where file doesn't exist
} else if err != nil {
  // other types of error
}
```
