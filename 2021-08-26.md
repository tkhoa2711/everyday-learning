# Rust Up!

Learning Rust is fun! (I hope).

## Installing the toolchain

Get `rustup` from [here](https://rustup.rs/) and then follow the instructions when
prompted in the terminal.

If installed with `brew`, you can initialize the toolchain with:

```sh
rustup init
```

## Create a new project

`cargo` should be installed as part of the initial setup. It is Rust package
manager, much like `npm` for JavaScript. It is a tool for managing Rust project,
executing tests, building artifacts, running the app and so on.

## Resources to get started

### The quick way

[A half hour to learn Rust](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/a-half-hour-to-learn-rust)
definitely takes more than half an hour for me to go through. Nonetheless, it's
still one of the best short introduction to Rust so far I've found for busy (or
lazy) people like me.

It gives a quick overview of the syntax and core concepts. Especially some of them
we as new starters wouldn't know what they're called in Rust.
