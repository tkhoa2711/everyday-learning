# SwiftUI's view builder supports no more than 10 sub views

The cause of this obscure error in SwiftUI is that the language creators decided
no more than 10 sub views are allowed e.g. in VStack, HStack. The solution is
to use `Group`.

```
Extra arguments at positions #11, #12 in call
```

The ultimate reason:

```
... Swift doesn't have variadic generics, 10 methods with different amounts of
generic args is the furthest the Apple engineer went before saying "aight f***
this"
```

# Open app settings from an iOS app

This will allow the app to the app's own settings, if available. Otherwise, it
will open the general Settings screen.

```swift
if let settingsUrl = URL(string: UIApplication.openSettingsURLString),
   UIApplication.shared.canOpenURL(settingsUrl) {
    UIApplication.shared.open(settingsUrl, completionHandler: nil)
}
```
