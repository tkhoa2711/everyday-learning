# Diagnose problem cloning from private repo in Docker after upgrading `openssl`

With a recent upgrade of `openssl` from `1.0` to `1.1`, suddenly I couldn't build
my Docker image where it needs to fetch dependencies hosted in private repos (I'm
using the new BuildKit build system to forward SSH agent connection). The fix
turns out to be adding back the necessary SSH private key:

```sh
$ eval $(ssh-agent)
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
