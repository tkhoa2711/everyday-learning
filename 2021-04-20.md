# Format `in` clause for SQL statements in Python

```py
values = ["value1", "value2"]
sql = f"SELECT * FROM table WHERE value IN {tuple(values)}"
# This would output: "SELECT * FROM table WHERE value IN ('value1', 'value2')"
```

The catch is with a list containing only 1 item, it will produce invalid SQL
code `('value1',)` so we'll need to handle it separately.
