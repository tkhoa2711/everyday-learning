# Cross-browsers testing with BrowserStack and TestCafe
I've been looking for a cross browser testing solution for a while.
I had the chance to work with BrowserStack, while it is hard to use,
due to slowness, it supports a comprehensive list of browsers. And
it also supports automation.

In addition, I also need a testing framework to go with BrowserStack.
While I like Cypress, it only supports Chrome at the moment, even though
cross browser testing is in their roadmap.

The first attempt with Selenium (and BrowserStack Local) works but
they're not fun to work with at all. Not only the execution is slow (our
team usage plan only allows 100 minutes of automation per month),
the setup is tricky to get it right.

After awhile, I found out that TestCafe has built-in integration with
BrowserStack. The configuration effort is almost none. Though
their syntax is not as great as Cypress, it is much easier to deal with
than Selenium.

I only need to use `dotenv-cli` to load environment variables from `.env`
file.
