# Things I learnt working with `docker-compose` in the last week
## Tiny things

- default user in a docker container is always `root`
- `$USER` environment variable isn't defined by default,
  see https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#env-environment-variables
- use `working_dir` to define default working directory when
  creating a new container

## Error: `port is already allocated`

  If you have the port binding like this defined in `docker-compose.yml`:
  
  ```yml
  ports:
      - 5432:5432
  ```
  
  Modify the config to:
  
  ```yml
  ports:
      - 5432
  ```
  
  This is due to the version of `docker-compose`.

## Access private GitHub repo from docker container

More often than not we'll need to clone private git repo from
your docker image.

```dockerfile
# add credentials on build
ARG SSH_PRIVATE_KEY
RUN mkdir /root/.ssh
RUN echo "${SSH_PRIVATE_KEY}" > /root/.ssh/id_rsa

# github requires restricted read access to the private key
RUN chmod 600 /root/.ssh/id_rsa

# make sure your domain is accepted
RUN touch /root/.ssh/known_hosts
RUN ssh-keyscan github.com >> /root/.ssh/known_hosts
```

There're a few reasonings behind these lines of code. First of all,
we're passing the content of the private key instead of the path
to the key. Due to docker limiting the access to files in the host
within the build context only, obvious we can't use `ADD` or `COPY`
to copy the physical `.ssh` file to the image.

We also have to add `github.com` to the `known_hosts`.
