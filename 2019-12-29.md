# Things I learnt working with `docker-compose` and `Docker` in the last week
## Tiny things

- default user in a docker container is always `root`
- `$USER` environment variable isn't defined by default,
  see https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#env-environment-variables
- use `working_dir` to define default working directory when
  creating a new container

## Error: `port is already allocated`

  If you have the port binding like this defined in `docker-compose.yml`:
  
  ```yml
  ports:
      - 5432:5432
  ```
  
  Modify the config to:
  
  ```yml
  ports:
      - 5432
  ```
  
  This is due to the version of `docker-compose`.

## Access private GitHub repo from docker container

More often than not we'll need to clone private git repo from
your docker image.

```dockerfile
# add credentials on build
ARG SSH_PRIVATE_KEY
RUN mkdir /root/.ssh
RUN echo "${SSH_PRIVATE_KEY}" > /root/.ssh/id_rsa

# github requires restricted read access to the private key
RUN chmod 600 /root/.ssh/id_rsa

# make sure your domain is accepted
RUN touch /root/.ssh/known_hosts
RUN ssh-keyscan github.com >> /root/.ssh/known_hosts
```

There're a few reasonings behind these lines of code. First of all,
we're passing the content of the private key instead of the path
to the key. Due to docker limiting the access to files in the host
within the build context only, obvious we can't use `ADD` or `COPY`
to copy the physical `.ssh` file to the image.

We also have to add `github.com` to the `known_hosts`.

## UPDATE: A better way to pass secrets during Docker build

From Docker version 18.09, a new build system called BuildKit is available
which has many enhancements. One of them is ability to seamlessly passing
secrets or using SSH to access private data in builds.

```Dockerfile
# syntax = docker/dockerfile:1.0-experimental
FROM alpine

# Install ssh client and git
RUN apk add --no-cache openssh-client git

# Add public keys for github.com
RUN mkdir -p -m 0600 ~/.ssh && ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

# Clone private repository
RUN --mount=type=ssh git clone git@github.com:myorg/myproject.git myproject

# You can use the above syntax with package managers to install dependencies
# that may include some privately-hosted or from private repositories.
# Example:
# RUN --mount=type=ssh yarn
# RUN --mount=type=ssh pipenv install
```

Note that you need to add the first line as above to tell Docker to use the
new frontend (which is required for the new syntax). Then execute the build
with:

```sh
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --ssh default .
```

You can omit `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1` if you have BuildKit enabled by default.
As you can see, the `Dockerfile` content is simplified significantly with
the new syntax. However, as of this writing, such feature is not available
in `docker-compose` yet.

# Build a docker image for a Python app

The application here has dependencies controlled by `pipenv`. It's
a Django app, however this should not affect the fact that this can
be applied to any Python application. In this application, I'm
assuming that the project is hosted on a private GitHub repo. The
`Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
# we use python:3.6 image because it has git installed by default
FROM python:3.6 as build-stage

# add credentials on build
ARG SSH_PRIVATE_KEY
RUN mkdir $HOME/.ssh
RUN echo "${SSH_PRIVATE_KEY}" > /root/.ssh/id_rsa

# github requires restricted read access to the private key
RUN chmod 600 /root/.ssh/id_rsa

# make sure your domain is accepted
RUN touch /root/.ssh/known_hosts
RUN ssh-keyscan github.com >> /root/.ssh/known_hosts

ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1
WORKDIR /app

RUN pip install pipenv
COPY ./Pipfile* /app/
RUN pipenv install --dev

# the final image
FROM python:3.6-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build-stage /root/.local/share/virtualenvs /root/.local/share/virtualenvs
COPY --from=build-stage /app /app

# we also need pipenv in the final image to activate
# the virtualenv installed by pipenv from previous stage
RUN pip install pipenv

# copy the source of the app to the image
COPY . /app/

EXPOSE 8000
```
