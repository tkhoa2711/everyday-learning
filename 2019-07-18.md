# AWS cli tries to fetch the URL when a param value is an URL

It's just crazy isn't it? See this issue for more info [https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/2507](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/2507)

The fix is applied from awscli version `1.15.148` and above.
You just need to add the following to your `~/.aws/config`

```conf
cli_follow_urlparam = false
```
