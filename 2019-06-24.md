# Mock functions in the same module with `jest`

Take this `foobar.js` module for example:

```js
export const foo = () => 'foo';

export const bar = () => `${foo()bar}`;
```

In the test file `foobar.spec.js`, normally this would be how we implement it:

```js
import * as foobar from './foobar';

describe('foobar', () => {
  it('bar', () => {
    jest.spyOn(foobar, 'foo').mockImplementation(() => 'mockFoo');

    expect(foobar.bar()).toEqual('mockFoobar');
  });
});
```

However, the above mocking won't work. This is because `bar` keeps the reference
to the orignal implementation of `foo`. When we think we replaced/mocked the `foo`
function with a new one, we just actually replaced the reference copy in the scope
of `foobar.spec.js`.

While there are a couple of solutions in the referenced StackOverflow page, I find
that the one using [`babel-plugin-rewire`](https://github.com/speedskater/babel-plugin-rewire/)
is the cleanest solution, the original implementation doesn't need modification,
but yes extra setup is required in the test. Here's how it would look like:

```js
import * as foobar, { __RewireAPI__ as foobarRewire } from './foobar';

describe('foobar', () => {
  it('bar', () => {
    // rewire the `foo` function
    foobarRewire.__Rewire__('foo', () => 'mockFoo');

    expect(foobar.bar()).toEqual('mockFoobar');

    // undo the rewiring
    apiRewire.__ResetDependency__('foo');
  });
});
```
