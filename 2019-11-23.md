# Setup Python environment the sane way (or so I think)
At my current employer, we use `pipenv`, it works well to me.
But some of our teammates reckon there's a lot of problems with
the tool and suggest moving away from it. This is one article
explaining the issue with `pipenv`
https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/07/17/pipenv-promises-a-lot-delivers-very-little/.

To get started, we should install and use `pip` the right way
as suggested here https://snarky.ca/why-you-should-use-python-m-pip/.
So let's install/upgrade the good 'ol `pip`:

```sh
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip [--user]
```

You might need `--user` to avoid permission problem during installation.
Then let's go ahead and create a new virtualenv:

```sh
# let's create the virtual environment in a generic directory
# under our project root directory
mkdir .venv; cd .venv
python3 -m venv my-env-name

# activate the new virtualenv
source .venv/my-env-name/bin/activate
```

Afterwards, you may install any necessary dependencies in this new env:

```sh
python3 -m pip install Django
```

Generating the list of dependencies is as simlpe as:

```sh
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

And when someone else start to work on the project, they can install
all specified dependencies by:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
