# Stop and remove a docker container in one command

Instead of issue two commands:

```sh
docker stop container_name|container_id
docker rm container_name|container_id
```

You can execute:

```sh
docker rm -f container_name|container_id
```

However, this should only be used if you don't care about the
existing container anymore. Executing `docker rm -f` issues a
`SIGKILL` signal to the container and migh not let container
exits gracefully.

Otherwise, use the chained version of the first two commands
to safely stop and remove a container:


```sh
docker stop container_id | xargs docker rm
```
