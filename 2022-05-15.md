# Implementing unique constraint on DynamoDB

Unfortunately this can't be enforced by the database itself. It has to be done
by the developers at the code level. One common approach is using
[condition expression](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.ConditionExpressions.html)
when inserting records.

```sh
aws dynamodb put-item \
  --table-name ProductCatalog \
  --item file://item.json \
  --condition-expression "attribute_not_exists(Id)"
```
