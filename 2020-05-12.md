# `ArrayField` rendered with multi-select checkboxes in Django admin

Today, I came across a situation where I need to create a new attribute
for a model that takes the shape of an array of string, and there
should be a limited options for people to select when editing that
field in Django admin. Immediately I think of a multi-select checkbox
that will intuitively fit the use case. However, Django admin by default
uses a very ugly UI widget for `ArrayField`.

The first solution I have here is to create a subclass of `ArrayField`
that will behave exactly like a normal array, with the bonus of being
render in Django admin as multi-select checkboxes.

```python
from django import forms
from django.contrib.postgres.fields import ArrayField

class ChoiceArrayField(ArrayField):
    """
    A field that allows us to store an array of choices.
    In Django admin, this field will be rendered as multi-select checkboxes.
    """

    def formfield(self, **kwargs):
        defaults = {
            "form_class": forms.MultipleChoiceField,
            "choices": self.base_field.choices,
            "widget": forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple,
        }
        defaults.update(kwargs)
        # Skip our parent's formfield implementation completely as we don't
        # care for it.
        return super(ArrayField, self).formfield(**defaults)
```

Then you can create a field in your model with this new class:

```python
from django.db import models

class MyModel(models.Model):
    CHOICES = (
        ("choice_1", "This is choice 1"),
    )

    selected_choice = ChoiceArrayField(
        models.CharField(max_length=255, choices=CHOICES),
        null=True, blank=True,
        help_text="The list of choices this instance has"
    )
```

When you create a new `ModelAdmin` for this `MyModel`, it should render
the `selected_choice` field as multi-select checkboxes that make it
intuitive to select/unselect the choices.

In case you don't want to change the way the model is define (i.e. keep
the original `ArrayField`, you can override the form field in the
`ModelAdmin` class. For example, the following code tells the model
admin to render `RichTextEditorWidget` for `TextField` fields.


```python
class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    formfield_overrides = {
        models.TextField: {"widget": RichTextEditorWidget},
    }
```
