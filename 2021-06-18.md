# Text vs varchar vs char in Postgres

TL;DR: They are not much different under the hood, and in terms of performance.
If unsure, just use `text`.

To sum them up in more words:

- `char(n)`: padded string with very little use case
- `varchar(n)`: dynamic length string, but can be problematic to change its limit
  in production
- `varchar`: unlimited length string, essentially it is `text`
- `text`: simple, easy to type and understand, suits most situations
