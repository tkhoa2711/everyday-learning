# Monitoring Docker containers in terminal

[`ctop`](https://github.com/bcicen/ctop) is a command line tool with
interface similar to `top` but for monitoring Docker containers in your
local machine. Its interface and commands are bare basic but helpful
enough for simple monitoring locally. Here's a sample screenplay from
its website:

# Bash autocomplete for docker cli (on Mac)

Make sure `bash-completion` is installed. In Mac OS, it's as easy as:

```sh
brew install bash-completion
```

Add the following to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` if you don't
have it already:

```bash
if [ -f $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion ]; then
  . $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion
fi
```

From Docker's documentation, it only has instructions to setup
autocomplete for `docker-compose` and `docker machine`:
- https://docs.docker.com/compose/completion/
- https://docs.docker.com/machine/completion/

It is simply placing a script into the directory `/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/`.
Regarding autocomplete for the `docker` command itself, surprisingly
the script can be found here `/Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/etc/`.
As a result, we may create a symbolic link with it:

```sh
ln -s /Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/etc/docker.bash-completion /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/
```

# Reorder `tmux` windows

The following command moves the current window to the left/right:

```tmux
swap-window -t -1|+1
```

For convenience, the below key bindings will be a further help:

```tmux
bind-key -n S-Left swap-window -d -t -1
bind-key -n S-Right swap-window -d -t +1
```

The `-d` option provides a more intuitive behaviour where it keeps
the focus on current window, but it's only available from version
`3.0a` onwards.

Then, with my `tmux` prefix bound to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd>,
I can simply move the current window to the left by
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd> then <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Left</kbd>.
