# To share the work, share the decisions

I read this [blog post](https://jessitron.com/2022/02/01/to-share-the-work-share)
today and it can't resonate more with me.

Shared understanding can't be created by one person sharing their understanding.
It must be created by all parties in the room. Everyone has to have a say in the
decisions.

Through the past 2 years, as both senior members of the team and the team lead,
I've noticed the pattern, and the difficulty, of influencing changes throughout
the organisation by "telling them what to do". The classic approach took a lot
of effort and rarely was effective.

It applies to both non-technical and technical changes. I can recall a few times
where a key person came up with an amazing architectural solution; then other
people joined the projects and had difficult time figuring out what exactly they
should do. Or many other times where I, as a lead engineer, came up with an
approach to a problem, broke them down into smaller tasks so the team can just
work on individual tasks easily. Guess what, it didn't work out. Team members
often lost track of the bigger picture and how individual pieces fit together -
solely because they weren't in "my head" when I came up with the solution.

It is way too easy to think that as a leader, you should solve the problem for
your team. Doing the heavy lifting here actually does more harm more than good.
