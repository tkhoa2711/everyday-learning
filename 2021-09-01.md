# Install new dependencies in Rust

There's no built-in command in `cargo` to add a new dependency yet. The workaround
at the moment is to add by hand or by using this temporary solution:

```sh
cargo install cargo-edit # installs "cargo add" command
cargo add image # adds "image" package into dependencies
```
