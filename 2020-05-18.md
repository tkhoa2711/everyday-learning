# Record macros in Vim

- Start recording a macro to a register (a single letter between `a` and `z`):
  ```vim
  q<register>
  ```
  For example:
  ```vim
  qa
  ```
- Do whatever you want to record. You may need to exit `insert` mode before the end.
- Stop recording with `q`
- Execute your macro with `@a`
- Execute it again with `@@`

View your recorded macros with `:registers` command. Please note it also
includes other registers other than the one reserved for macros.
