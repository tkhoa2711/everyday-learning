# Firebase - Firestore vs Realtime Database

Firebase offers two databases: Cloud Firestore (or Firestore in short) vs Realtime
Database. Firestore is the recommended option in most cases.

- Firestore is more general purpose, better querying, more structured data, more scalable,
  operation-based pricing
- Realtime Database has better realtime latency, might be cheaper in some cases due to
  storage-based or network-based pricing model
