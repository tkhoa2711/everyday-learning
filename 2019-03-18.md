# yarn link
There's a way for us to link local dependencies during development,
so that change in the depedency will be reflected in the main project.
Execute the below command in the package you wish to link to:

```
yarn link
```

Then in the main project, let's tell the main project to use the local
linkage for this dependency/package:

```
yarn link <package-name>
```

You may remove the link anytime with `yarn unlink`.
