# Use Terraform to configure DNS entry in Cloudflare
My usecase for this is to configure API for my application
to be a subdomain of my main domain, e.g. `subdomain.example.com`.
For example, if the application server is hosted on Heroku, the
`subdomain_dns` value will be something like `pointy_cove_123.herokudns.com`.

Here I assume that we've already purchased the `example.com`
domain and configure Cloudflare to be manage its DNS.

Here is the variable definition `varablles.tf`:

```tf
variable "domain" {
  description = "The base domain"
  default     = "example.com"
}

variable "api_token" {
  description = "The Cloudflare API token"
}

variable "subdomain_dns" {
  description = "Value of the DNS record for subdomain"
}
```

The main file `cloudflare.tf`:

```tf
provider "cloudflare" {
  version   = "~> 2.0"
  api_token = "${var.api_token}"
}

data "cloudflare_zones" "base_domain" {
  filter {
    name   = "${var.domain}"
    status = "active"
  }
}

# Create a record for "subdomain.example.com"
resource "cloudflare_record" "subdomain" {
  zone_id = "${lookup(data.cloudflare_zones.base_domain.zones[0], "id")}"
  name    = "subdomain"
  value   = "${var.subdomain_dns}"
  type    = "CNAME"
  proxied = false
}
```

Here we use API token to granularly control access to Cloudflare.
You may configure the token to have edit access only to a specific
domain (i.e. zone in Cloudflare term). However we still need to setup
read-only access to all zones (within your account) so that the
`filter` operation in the code above works. Maybe there's a better
way to refer to existing zone in Cloudflare without having to scan
every zones.

Please note that we need to set `proxied` to `false` for the record
since we only need this CNAME record to be routed to the Heroku DNS URL
mentioned previously. Perhaps this will be different when using other
service providers like AWS.
