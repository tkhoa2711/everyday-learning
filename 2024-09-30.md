# Cherry-pick a git commit from another repo locally

```sh
git --git-dir=../<some_other_repo>/.git \
format-patch -k -1 --stdout <commit SHA> | \
git am -3 -k
```

Explanation from one of the comments:

> the `git format-patch` command creates a patch from `some_other_repo`'s commit
> specified by its SHA (`-1` for one single commit alone). This patch is piped to
> `git am`, which applies the patch locally (`-3` means trying the three-way merge if
> the patch fails to apply cleanly)
