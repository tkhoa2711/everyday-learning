# Purge cache in Cloudflare

Cloudflare allows two way for us to clear the cache in its system so
users will be able to view updated versions of your website.

- **Purge everything** - this is self explanatory, but might not be exactly
  what we want in certain scenarios, especially if your domain is used to
  host several websites or web applications.
- **Custom purge** - this sounds better. However there is a catch, I bet 99%
  of us use the Cloudflare free plan, that means we can only purge by
  exact URL (also no wildcard allowed). The other two options, purging by 
  hostname and cache tag, are only available to enterprise plan. If you
  only have a few files to purge, this option should be sufficient. Otherwise
  you need to opt for "purge everything" to get it done.

To verify if your resources are refreshed after the purge, check that the
`cf-cache-status` header in the HTTP response is `MISS`, which means Cloudflare
couldn't find the cache for them and have to fetch a freshed new version.

Bonus: there is a Chrome plugin that allow us to perform custom purge easily
